# Shadow Work Prompts

Shadow work is the process of exploring one's "shadow self"—the parts of our personality that we unconsciously repress and hide. By bringing these aspects into the light, we can integrate them and become more whole. Here are some prompts to begin that process:

*   What traits in others irritate you the most, and how might they reflect something about yourself?
*   Describe a time you felt intense jealousy. What was the situation and what did you feel you were lacking?
*   What are you most afraid of others discovering about you?
*   Think about a recurring dream or nightmare. What themes or feelings are present?
*   When do you feel most powerless? What could give you a greater sense of agency in those moments?
