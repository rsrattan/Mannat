# Meditation Hub

Meditation is a core practice across a vast array of spiritual, religious, and magical traditions. While the techniques and goals may vary, the fundamental aim is often the cultivation of a focused, clear, and intentional state of consciousness. This hub serves as a central point to explore the diverse forms of meditation found within this vault.

## Core Types of Meditation

At a high level, many meditation practices can be understood as belonging to one of two categories:

*   **Concentrative/Focused Meditation:** The goal is to focus the mind on a single object, such as the breath, a mantra, a candle flame, or a specific concept. This builds mental discipline and stability.
*   **Open-Awareness/Mindfulness Meditation:** The goal is to cultivate a non-judgmental awareness of whatever arises in the present moment—thoughts, feelings, sensations, or external stimuli. This develops insight and acceptance.

Many traditions blend both of these approaches.
