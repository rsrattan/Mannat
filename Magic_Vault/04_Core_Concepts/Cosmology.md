# Cosmology

The science of the origin and development of the universe, often described in mythological or philosophical terms in ancient traditions. In esoteric contexts, cosmology often refers to a system of beliefs about the structure, origin, and destiny of the cosmos, and humanity's place within it.

## Esoteric Cosmologies
- Unlike scientific cosmologies, which rely on empirical observation and mathematical models, esoteric cosmologies are often derived from spiritual experiences, revelations, and ancient wisdom traditions.
- They frequently incorporate spiritual beings, divine hierarchies, and symbolic representations of the universe.

## Common Themes
- **Creation Myths:** Narratives explaining how the universe and life came into existence, often involving divine beings or primordial forces.
- **Hierarchical Structures:** Many cosmologies depict the universe as having multiple layers or planes of existence, from the material to the divine.
- **Interconnectedness:** The belief that all parts of the universe are interconnected and influence each other.

## Examples
- **The [[Tree of Life]] (Kabbalah):** A central diagram in Kabbalistic cosmology, representing the emanations of God and the structure of the universe.
- **The [[Nine Worlds]] (Norse Mythology):** A concept of cosmology in which the universe is composed of nine distinct realms, all held within the branches and roots of the world tree Yggdrasil.
- **Platonic Cosmology:** Based on Plato's philosophical ideas, describing a universe of ideal forms and their imperfect material reflections.
