# Energy Work

A broad category of practices involving the manipulation or channeling of subtle energies, such as Qi or Prana, to promote healing, well-being, and spiritual development. It is based on the belief that a vital life force flows through all living things.

- **Aura:** An energy field believed to emanate from all living things, often perceived as colored light, which reflects an individual's physical, emotional, and spiritual state.
- **Chakras:** Energy centers within the subtle body, believed to be responsible for various physiological and psychological functions.

## Methods and Practices

- **Hands-on Healing:** Practices like Reiki, therapeutic touch, or Qigong healing, where practitioners channel energy through their hands to a recipient.
