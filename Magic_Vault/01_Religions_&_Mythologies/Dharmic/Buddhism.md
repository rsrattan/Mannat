# Buddhism

A path of spiritual development that leads to an insight into the true nature of reality, based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha.

## The Four Noble Truths
1.  **Dukkha:** The Truth of Suffering. Life is inherently characterized by suffering and dissatisfaction.
2.  **Samudāya:** The Truth of the Origin of Suffering. The cause of suffering is craving, attachment, and aversion.
3.  **Nirodha:** The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering. It is possible to end suffering by eliminating craving, attachment, and aversion.
4.  **Magga:** The Truth of the Path to the Cessation of Suffering. The way to end suffering is to follow the Eightfold Path.

## The Eightfold Path
- Right Understanding, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration.

## Major Schools
- **Theravada:** The oldest surviving branch of Buddhism, prevalent in Southeast Asia.
- **Mahayana:** A broad group of traditions prevalent in East Asia, which emphasizes the path of the Bodhisattva.
- **Vajrayana:** Often considered a branch of Mahayana, it is the dominant form of Buddhism in Tibet and Bhutan.

## Core Meditation Practices
Meditation is the central practice in Buddhism for calming the mind, developing insight, and cultivating positive qualities.

- **Samatha (Calm Abiding):** This practice develops concentration and tranquility, often by focusing on the breath. It helps to stabilize the mind and bring thoughts to a restful state.
- **Vipassanā (Insight Meditation):** Building on the concentration from Samatha, Vipassanā involves observing thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations with clear awareness to gain deep insights into the nature of reality, such as impermanence and non-self.
- **Metta Bhavana (Loving-Kindness):** A practice aimed at cultivating boundless compassion and unconditional love, starting with oneself and gradually extending to all living beings.
- **Zazen (Seated Meditation):** The primary practice in Zen Buddhism, emphasizing precise posture and mindfulness of breathing, often involving "just sitting" (shikantaza) without a specific object of focus.
