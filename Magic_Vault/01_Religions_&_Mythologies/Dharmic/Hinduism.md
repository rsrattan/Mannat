## Meditation Practices
Hinduism includes a vast array of meditation techniques aimed at achieving spiritual purification and self-realization. These practices are designed to calm the mind and lead to a state of profound concentration and awareness.

- **Mantra Meditation (Japa):** One of the most common forms, involving the silent or audible repetition of a sacred sound, word, or phrase (mantra) to focus the mind and invoke divine energy.
- **Yoga Meditation (Dhyana):** As part of the eight limbs of Yoga, Dhyana is the practice of profound concentration on a single object or concept, leading to a state of deep meditation and absorption.
- **Chakra Meditation:** This practice focuses on the body's subtle energy centers (chakras), often using specific mantras, visualizations, or sounds to balance and awaken them.
- **Gazing Meditation (Trataka):** Unlike other forms, this involves keeping the eyes open and fixing the gaze on an external point, such as a candle flame or a sacred image, to build concentration and still the mind.
