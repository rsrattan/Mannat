# Kubera

Kubera is the Hindu god of wealth and the king of the semi-divine Yakshas. He is regarded as the regent of the North (Dik-pala), and a protector of the world (Lokapala). While Lakshmi represents overall prosperity and fortune, Kubera is specifically associated with material wealth and treasures.

## Symbolism

*   **Pot-bellied form:** Kubera is often depicted with a pot-belly, adorned with jewels, and carrying a money-pot or a bag of gold coins.
*   **Mongoose:** He is sometimes shown with a mongoose, as the mongoose is considered a symbol of wealth and victory over nagas (serpents), who are often guardians of treasure.
*   **Pushpaka Vimana:** He is the original owner of the mythical flying chariot, the Pushpaka Vimana.
