# Karma

Karma is the principle of cause and effect, where the intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence their future (effect). It is a fundamental concept in the Dharmic religions.

## Key Aspects
- **Action and Consequence:** Every action, thought, and word has a corresponding consequence.
- **Moral Causality:** Good actions lead to positive outcomes, while harmful actions lead to negative ones.
- **Rebirth:** Karma is believed to determine the nature of one's existence in the cycle of rebirth ([[Samsara]]).

## Meditating on Karma
Meditation on karma is a form of analytical reflection and mindfulness. It involves observing one's thoughts, words, and actions without judgment, and contemplating their potential consequences for oneself and others. This practice cultivates a deep sense of moral responsibility and encourages the development of wholesome intentions, leading to a more skillful and compassionate way of living. By understanding the mechanics of cause and effect in one's own life, one can actively shape a more positive future.
