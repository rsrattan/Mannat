# Dharma

Dharma is a key concept with multiple meanings in the Dharmic religions. In Hinduism, it refers to one's duty, virtue, and the cosmic order that sustains the universe. In Buddhism, it primarily refers to the teachings of the Buddha.

## In Hinduism
- **Sanatana Dharma:** The "eternal law" or the natural and eternal order of things.
- **Svadharma:** One's own individual duty or path in life, based on their age, caste, and station.

## In Buddhism
- **The Buddha's Teachings:** The collective teachings of the Buddha, which constitute the path to enlightenment.
- **Cosmic Law:** The underlying natural order and law of the cosmos.

## Meditating on Dharma
Analytical meditation on the concept of Dharma is a practice of deep reflection. It involves contemplating one's own duties, actions, and path in life (Svadharma) and how they align with the universal cosmic order (Sanatana Dharma). In a Buddhist context, it means reflecting on the Buddha's teachings to gain insight into the nature of reality. This practice is not about emptying the mind, but about using the intellect to cultivate wisdom and clarity, leading to a more purposeful and aligned life.
