# Reincarnation (Samsara)

Reincarnation, known as Samsara in Dharmic traditions, is the concept that the soul or spirit, after death, can begin a new life in a new body. This cycle of death and rebirth is central to Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism.

## The Goal
- The ultimate goal in these traditions is to achieve **Moksha** (in Hinduism) or **Nirvana** (in Buddhism), which is the liberation from the cycle of Samsara.
- This liberation is achieved by extinguishing [[Karma]] and realizing the true nature of the self ([[Atman]]) and reality.

## Meditating on Samsara
Contemplating the nature of Samsara is a key analytical meditation in many Dharmic traditions. This practice involves reflecting on the endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, and the inherent suffering and impermanence of all conditioned existence. The purpose of this meditation is not to induce despair, but to cultivate a profound sense of spiritual urgency (Samvega) and a deep motivation to pursue the path of liberation (Moksha/Nirvana) with diligence and sincerity.
