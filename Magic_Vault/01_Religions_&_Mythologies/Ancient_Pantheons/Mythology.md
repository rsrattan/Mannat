# Mythology

Mythology is a collection of myths, especially one belonging to a particular religious or cultural tradition. Myths are symbolic narratives that are not literally true but convey profound truths about a culture's worldview, values, and origins.

## Functions of Myth
- **Metaphysical:** Explaining the origins of the universe and humanity's place within it.
- **Cosmological:** Describing the shape and nature of the cosmos.
- **Sociological:** Supporting and validating a certain social order.
- **Pedagogical:** Teaching individuals how to live a human lifetime under any circumstances.

## Meditating on Myths
Myths serve as powerful tools for meditation and psychological exploration. By contemplating a myth or a specific mythological figure, one can connect with the universal archetypes they represent. This practice, often a form of imaginative or analytical meditation, can lead to profound insights into one's own psyche, life challenges, and personal journey. It involves immersing oneself in the story, identifying with different characters, and reflecting on the symbolic meaning of the narrative's events and themes.
