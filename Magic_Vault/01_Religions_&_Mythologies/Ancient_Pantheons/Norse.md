# Norse Pantheon

The deities of the North Germanic people, featuring figures like Odin, Thor, and Loki, and tales of Ragnarök. The mythology is preserved in texts like the Poetic Edda and Prose Edda.

## Major Groups of Deities
- **The Aesir:** The primary pantheon, containing gods of war and governance, such as Odin and Thor. They reside in Asgard.
- **The Vanir:** A second group of gods associated with fertility, wisdom, and the ability to see the future, such as Freya and Freyr.

## Core Concepts
- **The Nine Worlds:** A concept of cosmology in which the universe is composed of nine distinct realms, all held within the branches and roots of the world tree.
- **Yggdrasil:** The immense and central sacred tree that connects the Nine Worlds.

## Key Events
- **Ragnarök:** A series of future events, including a great battle, foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number of major figures (including the gods Odin, Thor, and Loki), the occurrence of various natural disasters, and the subsequent submersion of the world in water.

## Contemplative & Meditative Practices
Norse paganism and its modern revival, Heathenry, include contemplative practices aimed at connecting with the divine, nature, and ancestral wisdom.

- **Utiseta (Sitting Out):** A historical practice of sitting in a secluded outdoor location, often on a burial mound, for silent reflection, to commune with spirits, or to gain wisdom.
- **Visualization and Journeying:** A common practice involves using visualization to journey through the Nine Worlds of Norse cosmology, encounter deities, or connect with spiritual guides. This is a form of active, imaginative meditation.
- **Rune Meditation:** This practice involves focusing on a specific rune, either by visualizing it, chanting its name, or physically holding it. The goal is to gain insight into its symbolic meaning and connect with the energies it represents.
