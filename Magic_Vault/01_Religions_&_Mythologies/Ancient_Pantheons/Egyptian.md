The deities worshipped in ancient Egypt, centered on concepts of creation, the afterlife, and the divinity of the pharaoh.

## Key Deities
- **Ra:** The sun god, one of the most important deities.

## Afterlife Beliefs
- **Duat:** The realm of the dead, ruled by Osiris.
- **Weighing of the Heart:** A ceremony where a deceased person's heart was weighed against the feather of Ma'at to determine their fate in the afterlife.

## Contemplative & Meditative Practices
Ancient Egyptian spiritual practices were aimed at achieving harmony (Ma'at) and communicating with the divine. These have been adapted in modern Kemetic revivalism.

- **Breathwork and Visualization:** Ancient practices involved using controlled breathing to calm the mind and visualizing sacred symbols like the Ankh or specific deities to connect with their energies.
- **Chanting:** The repetition of sacred phrases and the names of gods and goddesses was a common practice used to raise spiritual energy and focus the mind, often performed in temples.
- **Modern Kemetic Yoga:** A modern system inspired by ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs and imagery. It combines physical postures, deep breathing, and meditation to unify the body and spirit (Smai Tawi).
