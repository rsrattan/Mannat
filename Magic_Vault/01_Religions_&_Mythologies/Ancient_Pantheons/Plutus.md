# Plutus

Plutus is the Greek god of wealth. In mythology, he is often depicted as being blinded by Zeus, so that he would distribute his gifts without prejudice. He is also sometimes shown as lame, as he takes his time in arriving, and winged, so he leaves faster than he came.

## Mythology

Plutus appears in several Greek works, most notably in Aristophanes' play "Plutus," where he is cured of his blindness and is able to distribute wealth to the deserving, rather than randomly. This highlights the Greek philosophical exploration of wealth, its distribution, and its relationship to morality.

## Meditating with the Archetype of Plutus

Unlike deities with established devotional traditions, meditating with Plutus is more of an archetypal or philosophical contemplation. It is a way to explore your own relationship with wealth.

1.  **Contemplation on the Nature of Wealth:** Find a quiet space to sit and reflect. Consider the dual nature of Plutus: blind and sighted.
    *   **Blind Plutus:** Meditate on the random nature of fortune. How does wealth flow in the world without regard to merit? Contemplate your own experiences of luck and chance. This can help in letting go of feelings of injustice or envy.
    *   **Sighted Plutus:** Now, imagine Plutus with his sight restored. What does it mean to be "deserving" of wealth? Meditate on your own virtues, skills, and the value you bring to the world. This is not about ego, but about recognizing your own worthiness to receive.

2.  **Inner Dialogue:** Engage in an inner dialogue with the archetype of Plutus. Ask questions like:
    *   "What are my blockages to receiving wealth?"
    *   "What is my true relationship with money?"
    *   "How can I align my actions with my financial goals?"

3.  **Gratitude:** Whether you feel you have a little or a lot, practice gratitude for the wealth you currently have. This shifts your mindset from lack to abundance, which is a key principle in attracting more wealth.
