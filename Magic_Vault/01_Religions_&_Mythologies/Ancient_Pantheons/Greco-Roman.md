# Greco-Roman Pantheon

The gods and goddesses of ancient Greece and their Roman counterparts, forming the foundation of classical mythology. The Roman pantheon largely adopted the Greek figures but changed their names.

## The Twelve Olympians (Greek / Roman)
- **Zeus / Jupiter:** King of the gods, god of sky and thunder.
- **Hera / Juno:** Queen of the gods, goddess of marriage and birth.
- **Poseidon / Neptune:** God of the sea.
- **Hades / Pluto:** King of the Underworld.
- **Demeter / Ceres:** Goddess of the harvest.
- **Ares / Mars:** God of war.
- **Athena / Minerva:** Goddess of wisdom and warfare.
- **Apollo / Apollo:** God of music, arts, and prophecy.
- **Artemis / Diana:** Goddess of the hunt and the moon.
- **Hephaestus / Vulcan:** God of fire and metalworking.
- **Aphrodite / Venus:** Goddess of love and beauty.
- **Hermes / Mercury:** Messenger of the gods.

## Key Concepts
- **Hubris:** Excessive pride or defiance toward the gods, often leading to a character's downfall.
- **Xenia:** The ancient Greek concept of hospitality, the generosity and courtesy shown to those who are far from home.

## Mythological Themes
- **Epic Journeys:** As seen in Homer's *The Odyssey*.
- **Tragic Heroes:** Noble characters who are destined for suffering and downfall, as in the plays of Sophocles.

## Philosophical & Meditative Practices
While not always framed as "meditation," Greco-Roman philosophy was rich with "spiritual exercises" designed to cultivate tranquility and self-awareness.

- **Stoic Meditation:** The Stoics practiced *prosoche* (attention), a state of continuous mindfulness on the present moment. A key exercise was *praemeditatio malorum*, the premeditation of adversity, where one visualizes potential misfortunes to build psychological resilience.
- **Platonic Meditation:** Platonism, especially in its later forms, involved elevating the soul through contemplation of the divine Forms. This could involve deep reflection on metaphysical concepts or geometric forms to achieve *henosis*, or union with 'the One'.
- **Epicurean Meditation:** Epicureans practiced meditating on core principles to alleviate fear, such as the *tetrapharmakos* (the "four-part cure"). They would also focus their minds on pleasant memories to maintain a state of tranquility.
