# Polytheism

Polytheism is the worship of or belief in multiple deities, which are usually assembled into a pantheon of gods and goddesses, along with their own religions and rituals.

## Contrast with Monotheism
- **Polytheism** posits a world with a diversity of divine beings, each with their own domains and personalities. Examples include the ancient Greek, Egyptian, and Norse pantheons.
- **Monotheism** is the belief in a single, all-powerful deity. Examples include the [[Abrahamic Religions]].
