# Polytheism

Polytheism is the worship of or belief in multiple deities, which are usually assembled into a pantheon of gods and goddesses, along with their own religions and rituals.

## Contrast with Monotheism
- **Polytheism** posits a world with a diversity of divine beings, each with their own domains and personalities. Examples include the ancient Greek, Egyptian, and Norse pantheons.
- **Monotheism** is the belief in a single, all-powerful deity. Examples include the [[Abrahamic Religions]].

## Meditating within a Polytheistic Framework
Meditation in a polytheistic context often involves focusing on a specific deity to connect with their unique qualities and domain. A practitioner might meditate on the wisdom of Athena, the creative fire of Brigid, or the transformative power of Shiva. This can be done through visualization (imagining the deity), chanting their name or epithets, or contemplating their associated myths and symbols. This approach allows for a diverse range of meditative experiences, tailored to the specific spiritual needs of the moment, such as seeking inspiration, courage, compassion, or wisdom.
