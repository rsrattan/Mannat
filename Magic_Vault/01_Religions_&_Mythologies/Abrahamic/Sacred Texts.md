# Sacred Texts in Abrahamic Religions

Sacred texts are the foundational scriptures that are believed to be divinely inspired or revealed, forming the basis of belief and practice in the Abrahamic faiths.

## Primary Texts
- **[[Torah]] (Judaism):** The central and most important document of Judaism, given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai.
- **[[Bible]] (Christianity):** Consists of the Old Testament (the Hebrew Bible) and the New Testament, which documents the life of Jesus and the early church.
- **[[Quran]] (Islam):** Believed to be the literal word of God (Allah) as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.

## Meditative Reading of Sacred Texts
Contemplative reading is a form of meditation where one slowly and reflectively reads a passage from a sacred text, seeking not just intellectual understanding but a deeper, spiritual connection to the words and their meaning. This practice allows the text to speak to the heart and spirit.

- **Example:** The Christian practice of [[Lectio Divina]] (Divine Reading) involves a four-step process of reading (lectio), meditation (meditatio), prayer (oratio), and contemplation (contemplatio) on a scripture passage. Similar methods of deep, reflective reading exist in Jewish and Islamic traditions.
