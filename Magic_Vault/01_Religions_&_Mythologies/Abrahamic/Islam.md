## Meditative & Contemplative Practices
Islamic meditation aims to purify the heart and achieve a profound connection with Allah. These practices are particularly central to [[Sufism]], the mystical dimension of Islam, which seeks a direct, personal experience of God.

- **Dhikr (Remembrance):** The constant, meditative remembrance of God, often through the rhythmic repetition of His names or devotional phrases. It is a powerful tool for achieving inner peace and awareness of the Divine.
- **Muraqaba (Silent Meditation):** A practice of silent meditation where one focuses solely on the presence of Allah, aiming to feel that God is always watching. It is similar to mindfulness but with a divine focus.
- **Fikr (Contemplation):** The practice of deep reflection on the signs of God's creation, His blessings, and the messages of the Quran. This leads to a deeper sense of gratitude and understanding.
