# Christianity

An Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.

## Core Beliefs
- **The Holy Trinity:** The belief in one God who exists in three divine persons: the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit.
- **Divinity of Jesus:** The belief that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, both fully divine and fully human.
- **Resurrection:** The belief that Jesus rose from the dead three days after his crucifixion, overcoming death and offering eternal life to believers.

## Sacred Text
- **The Bible:** The primary sacred scripture of Christianity, consisting of the Old Testament (shared with Judaism) and the New Testament (detailing the life and teachings of Jesus and his apostles).

## Major Branches
- [[Catholicism]]
- [[Protestantism]]
- [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]

## Contemplative Practices
Christian meditation is not about emptying the mind, but rather filling it with God-centered thoughts to foster a deeper personal relationship. It is a structured form of prayer that involves active reflection on God's revelations.

- **Lectio Divina (Divine Reading):** A traditional monastic practice of scriptural reading, meditation, and prayer intended to promote communion with God and to increase the knowledge of God's word.
- **[[Centering Prayer]]:** A method of silent prayer that prepares us to receive the gift of contemplative prayer, in which we experience God's presence within us. It involves choosing a sacred word to recenter the mind when thoughts wander.
- **Imaginative Prayer (Ignatian Contemplation):** A practice of using one's imagination to place oneself within a scene from the scriptures, experiencing it with all the senses to draw closer to God.
