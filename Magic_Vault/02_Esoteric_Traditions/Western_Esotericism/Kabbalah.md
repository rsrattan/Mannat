# Kabbalah

An esoteric method, discipline, and school of thought in Jewish mysticism. It is a set of teachings meant to explain the relationship between an unchanging, eternal, and mysterious God—the infinite Ein Sof (אין סוף)—and the mortal, finite universe (God's creation).

## Core Concepts
- **The Sefirot:** The ten emanations or attributes through which Ein Sof (the Infinite) reveals Himself and continuously creates both the physical realm and the chain of higher metaphysical realms.
- **The Tree of Life:** A diagrammatic representation of the ten Sefirot and the 22 paths connecting them, symbolizing the path to spiritual development and the structure of the universe.

## Key Texts
- **The Zohar:** The foundational work in the literature of Jewish mystical thought known as Kabbalah.
- **Sefer Yetzirah:** (Book of Creation) One of the earliest extant books on Jewish mysticism, dealing with the creation of the world through numbers and letters.

## Types of Kabbalah
- **Jewish Kabbalah:** The traditional, religious form of Kabbalah practiced within Judaism.
- **Christian/Hermetic Qabalah:** Later, non-Jewish adaptations of Kabbalistic principles, often integrated into Western esotericism and magic.

## Meditative Practices
Kabbalistic meditation aims to purify the individual and allow them to access higher spiritual realms and a deeper perception of God.

- **Contemplation of the Sefirot:** A primary practice involves meditating on the attributes of the ten Sefirot on the [[Tree of Life]]. Practitioners may visualize ascending the tree or focus on the qualities of a specific Sefirah to integrate its energy.
- **Permutation of Divine Names:** Advanced practices, notably from the school of Abraham Abulafia, involve the mental and vocal permutation of Hebrew letters, particularly those of divine names. This is intended to induce a higher state of consciousness.
- **Hitbonenut (Contemplation):** In the Hasidic tradition, this is an active meditation on a spiritual concept. The goal is to gain a deep, intuitive understanding that goes beyond mere intellectual knowledge, leading to an expansion of consciousness.
