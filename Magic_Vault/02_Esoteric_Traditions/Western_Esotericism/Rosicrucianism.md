# Rosicrucianism

Rosicrucianism is a spiritual and cultural movement that arose in Europe in the early 17th century after the publication of several manifestos which purported to announce the existence of a secret order of alchemists and sages.

## Origins
- The movement is traditionally attributed to **Christian Rosenkreuz**, a legendary figure said to have traveled to the Middle East to learn esoteric wisdom.
- The manifestos, *Fama Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis* and *Confessio Fraternitatis*, invited scholars to join the order to reform Europe.

## Key Principles
- **Esoteric Christianity:** Rosicrucianism often blends Christian mysticism with Hermetic principles, alchemy, and Kabbalah.
- **Hidden Wisdom:** Emphasis on secret knowledge and spiritual enlightenment through study and practice.
- **Healing and Transformation:** Focus on spiritual and physical healing, and the transformation of the self.
