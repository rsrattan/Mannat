# Hermeticism

A philosophical and religious tradition based upon the writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, a syncretic figure combining the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth.

## Core Texts
- **The Corpus Hermeticum:** A collection of 17 Greek writings whose authorship is traditionally attributed to Hermes Trismegistus.
- **The Kybalion:** A 20th-century book that summarizes Hermetic philosophy, outlining its seven core principles.

## The Seven Principles
1.  [[The Principle of Mentalism]]
2.  [[The Principle of Correspondence]]
3.  [[The Principle of Vibration]]
4.  [[The Principle of Polarity]]
5.  [[The Principle of Rhythm]]
6.  [[The Principle of Cause and Effect]]
7.  [[The Principle of Gender]]

## Key Concepts
- **"As above, so below":** This phrase, from the Emerald Tablet, encapsulates the Principle of Correspondence—the idea that the macrocosm (the universe) and the microcosm (the individual) are reflections of each other.
- **The All:** The ultimate reality or sum total of all that is, was, and ever shall be. According to the Principle of Mentalism, the Universe is a mental creation of The All.

## Meditative Practices
Hermetic meditation focuses on understanding the fundamental laws of the universe and achieving a union with "The All." It is a practice of both contemplation and inner alchemy.

- **Contemplation of the Principles:** A core practice involves deep meditation on the Seven Hermetic Principles, observing how they manifest in one's own life and in the universe at large. This leads to a profound understanding of reality.
- **Visualization of Interconnectedness:** To internalize the principle of "As above, so below," practitioners may visualize the cosmos within themselves and themselves within the cosmos, fostering a sense of unity with all existence.
- **Dialogue with the Higher Self (Nous):** The Corpus Hermeticum describes dialogues between a student and a divine teacher (Nous, or Mind). This can be adapted as a meditation practice involving an inner dialogue with one's higher self to receive guidance and wisdom.
