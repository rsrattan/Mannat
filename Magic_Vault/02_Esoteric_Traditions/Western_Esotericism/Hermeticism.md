# Hermeticism

A philosophical and religious tradition based upon the writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, a syncretic figure combining the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth.

## Core Texts
- **The Corpus Hermeticum:** A collection of 17 Greek writings whose authorship is traditionally attributed to Hermes Trismegistus.
- **The Kybalion:** A 20th-century book that summarizes Hermetic philosophy, outlining its seven core principles.

## The Seven Principles
1.  [[The Principle of Mentalism]]
2.  [[The Principle of Correspondence]]
3.  [[The Principle of Vibration]]
4.  [[The Principle of Polarity]]
5.  [[The Principle of Rhythm]]
6.  [[The Principle of Cause and Effect]]
7.  [[The Principle of Gender]]

## Key Concepts
- **"As above, so below":** This phrase, from the Emerald Tablet, encapsulates the Principle of Correspondence—the idea that the macrocosm (the universe) and the microcosm (the individual) are reflections of each other.
- **The All:** The ultimate reality or sum total of all that is, was, and ever shall be. According to the Principle of Mentalism, the Universe is a mental creation of The All.
