# Thelema

A social or spiritual philosophy derived from Western esotericism, developed by Aleister Crowley, an English occultist, writer, and ceremonial magician. It is based on the central philosophical principle of "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law."

## Core Tenets
- **The Law of Thelema:** "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will." This is not a license for hedonism but an injunction to discover and act upon one's True Will.
- **True Will:** The unique destiny or purpose of each individual, which is in harmony with the divine will of the universe. Discovering and fulfilling one's True Will is the central aim of Thelemic practice.

## Key Figures
- **Aleister Crowley:** The founder of Thelema, who claimed to have received *The Book of the Law* (Liber AL vel Legis) in Cairo, Egypt, in 1904.
- **Rose Edith Crowley:** Aleister Crowley's first wife, who played a crucial role in the reception of *The Book of the Law*.

## Practices
- **Ritual Magic:** Thelemites often engage in ceremonial magic, drawing from various traditions including the Golden Dawn and Enochian magic.
- **Yoga and Meditation:** Practices aimed at stilling the mind and achieving higher states of consciousness to aid in the discovery of True Will.
