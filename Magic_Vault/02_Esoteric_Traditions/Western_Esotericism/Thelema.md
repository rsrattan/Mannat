# Thelema

A social or spiritual philosophy derived from Western esotericism, developed by Aleister Crowley, an English occultist, writer, and ceremonial magician. It is based on the central philosophical principle of "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law."

## Core Tenets
- **The Law of Thelema:** "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will." This is not a license for hedonism but an injunction to discover and act upon one's True Will.
- **True Will:** The unique destiny or purpose of each individual, which is in harmony with the divine will of the universe. Discovering and fulfilling one's True Will is the central aim of Thelemic practice.

## Key Figures
- **Aleister Crowley:** The founder of Thelema, who claimed to have received *The Book of the Law* (Liber AL vel Legis) in Cairo, Egypt, in 1904.
- **Rose Edith Crowley:** Aleister Crowley's first wife, who played a crucial role in the reception of *The Book of the Law*.

## Meditative & Spiritual Practices
Thelemic spiritual practices are diverse, incorporating meditation, yoga, and ritual, all aimed at the central goal of discovering and enacting one's True Will.

- **Raja Yoga:** Thelemites practice Raja Yoga to gain control over the mind. This involves developing concentration (Dharana) and one-pointedness of thought (Dhyana) to achieve a state of union (Samadhi), which is essential for perceiving one's True Will without the interference of the ego.
- **Liber Resh vel Helios:** A daily practice of four solar adorations, performed at sunrise, noon, sunset, and midnight. This ritual attunes the practitioner to the natural cycle of the sun and serves as a regular, brief meditation and affirmation of Thelemic principles.
- **Assumption of God-forms:** An imaginative meditation where the practitioner visualizes themselves as a specific deity, taking on their symbolic form and attributes. This is used to connect with the archetypal energies that the deity represents.
- **Ritual Magic:** Ceremonial rituals like the [[Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram]] are used to purify the practitioner's space and mind, creating an environment conducive to meditation and higher magical work.
