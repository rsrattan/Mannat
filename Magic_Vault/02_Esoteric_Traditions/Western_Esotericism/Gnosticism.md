# Gnosticism

A collection of ancient religious ideas and systems which originated in the first century AD among early Christian and Jewish sects. Gnostics believed that salvation is achieved through gnosis, a special, intuitive knowledge of spiritual truths.

## Core Beliefs
- **The Demiurge:** A lesser, imperfect creator god, often identified with the God of the Old Testament, who created the material world.
- **Sophia:** A divine feminine emanation from the true God, whose fall from grace led to the creation of the Demiurge and the material world.
- **Divine Spark:** The belief that humans possess a divine spark of the true God trapped within their material bodies, which can be liberated through gnosis.

## Key Figures & Texts
- **Valentinus:** A prominent Gnostic teacher from the 2nd century AD, whose school was influential in early Gnosticism.
- **The Gospel of Thomas:** A non-canonical gospel discovered in the Nag Hammadi library, containing sayings attributed to Jesus, often interpreted from a Gnostic perspective.

## Impact
- Gnosticism significantly influenced early Christian thought, leading to various heresies and theological debates. Its themes of hidden knowledge and spiritual liberation continue to resonate in modern esoteric and New Age movements.
