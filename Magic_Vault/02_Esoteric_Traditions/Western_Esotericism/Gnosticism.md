# Gnosticism

A collection of ancient religious ideas and systems which originated in the first century AD among early Christian and Jewish sects. Gnostics believed that salvation is achieved through gnosis, a special, intuitive knowledge of spiritual truths.

## Core Beliefs
- **The Demiurge:** A lesser, imperfect creator god, often identified with the God of the Old Testament, who created the material world.
- **Sophia:** A divine feminine emanation from the true God, whose fall from grace led to the creation of the Demiurge and the material world.
- **Divine Spark:** The belief that humans possess a divine spark of the true God trapped within their material bodies, which can be liberated through gnosis.

## Key Figures & Texts
- **Valentinus:** A prominent Gnostic teacher from the 2nd century AD, whose school was influential in early Gnosticism.
- **The Gospel of Thomas:** A non-canonical gospel discovered in the Nag Hammadi library, containing sayings attributed to Jesus, often interpreted from a Gnostic perspective.

## Impact
- Gnosticism significantly influenced early Christian thought, leading to various heresies and theological debates. Its themes of hidden knowledge and spiritual liberation continue to resonate in modern esoteric and New Age movements.

## Contemplative Practices for Gnosis
The central aim of Gnostic meditation is to achieve *Gnosis*—a direct, experiential knowledge of the Divine that leads to spiritual liberation.

- **Silent Witnessing:** A practice similar to mindfulness, where one observes thoughts, emotions, and sensations without judgment. This helps to detach from the ego and the distractions of the material world, creating space for Gnosis to arise.
- **Contemplation of the Divine Spark:** Meditating on the concept of the divine spark within. This involves turning awareness inward to connect with the fragment of the true God that resides in the heart, seeking to recognize one's own divine nature.
- **Focus on a Mantra or Text:** Using a sacred word, phrase, or a passage from a Gnostic text as a focal point. This practice helps to quiet the discursive mind and attune the practitioner to a higher state of consciousness.
