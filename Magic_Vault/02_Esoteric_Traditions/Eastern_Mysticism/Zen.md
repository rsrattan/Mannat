# Zen Buddhism

Zen is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that emphasizes rigorous self-control, meditation-practice, insight into Buddhist teachings, and the personal expression of this insight in daily life, especially for the benefit of others.

## Origins
- Zen originated in China with the monk Bodhidharma in the 5th century CE, where it was known as Chan Buddhism.
- It later spread to Vietnam, Korea, and Japan, where it became known as Zen.

## Key Practices
- **Zazen:** Seated meditation, often practiced for extended periods, aimed at achieving a state of thoughtless awareness or concentrated introspection.
- **Koans:** Paradoxical riddles or questions used in Rinzai Zen to provoke a sudden awakening or insight in the practitioner.
- **Satori:** A sudden enlightenment or awakening in Zen Buddhism, often triggered by a koan or intense meditation, leading to a profound understanding of reality.
