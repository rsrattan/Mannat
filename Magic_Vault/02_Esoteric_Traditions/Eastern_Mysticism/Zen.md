# Zen Buddhism

Zen is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that emphasizes rigorous self-control, meditation-practice, insight into Buddhist teachings, and the personal expression of this insight in daily life, especially for the benefit of others.

## Origins
- Zen originated in China with the monk Bodhidharma in the 5th century CE, where it was known as Chan Buddhism.
- It later spread to Vietnam, Korea, and Japan, where it became known as Zen.

## Key Practices
- **Zazen (Seated Meditation):** This is the foundational practice of Zen. It involves a precise, stable posture and a focus on the breath. In the Soto school, the practice is often called *Shikantaza* or "just sitting," where the practitioner observes thoughts without judgment, allowing them to arise and pass away naturally.
- **Kinhin (Walking Meditation):** A form of walking meditation practiced between long periods of zazen. It involves mindful, slow, and deliberate walking, synchronizing movement with the breath to maintain a continuous state of awareness.
- **Koan Practice:** In the Rinzai school, practitioners meditate on paradoxical riddles or questions (koans) given by a teacher. The aim is not to solve them logically but to exhaust the analytical mind, leading to a sudden breakthrough of insight (*kensho* or *satori*).
- **Satori:** A sudden enlightenment or awakening in Zen Buddhism, often triggered by a koan or intense meditation, leading to a profound understanding of reality.
