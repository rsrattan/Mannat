# Tantra

An esoteric tradition of Hinduism and Buddhism that seeks to use the divine power of the universe for spiritual advancement. Tantra emphasizes the interconnectedness of the microcosm (human body) and the macrocosm (universe), and often involves ritual, yoga, and meditation to achieve liberation.

## Core Concepts
- **Kundalini:** A divine cosmic energy believed to reside at the base of the spine, which can be awakened through Tantric practices to ascend through the chakras.
- **Chakras:** Energy centers located along the spine, each associated with different psychological and spiritual functions.

## Meditative Practices
Unlike meditations that aim to empty the mind, Tantric meditation actively uses energy and form—such as sounds, visualizations, and breath—to transform consciousness.

- **Kundalini Meditation:** A central practice aimed at awakening the dormant [[Kundalini]] energy at the base of the spine and guiding it upward through the [[Chakras]]. This is often achieved through a combination of breathwork (pranayama), postures (asanas), and chanting.
- **Deity Visualization (Dhyāna):** This involves the detailed, internal visualization of a specific deity. The practitioner meditates on the deity's form and attributes, seeking to merge with its divine consciousness and embody its qualities.
- **Mantra & Yantra Meditation:** The use of sacred sounds (mantras) and geometric diagrams (yantras) as focal points. The practitioner may chant a mantra while gazing at its corresponding yantra, a practice that combines sound and sight to concentrate the mind and invoke specific energies.
## Types of Tantra
- **Right-Hand Tantra:** Generally refers to practices that are more conservative and adhere to traditional moral codes.
- **Left-Hand Tantra:** Often involves practices that challenge conventional norms, sometimes including taboo elements, to achieve spiritual breakthroughs.
