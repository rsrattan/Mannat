# Tantra

An esoteric tradition of Hinduism and Buddhism that seeks to use the divine power of the universe for spiritual advancement. Tantra emphasizes the interconnectedness of the microcosm (human body) and the macrocosm (universe), and often involves ritual, yoga, and meditation to achieve liberation.

## Core Concepts
- **Kundalini:** A divine cosmic energy believed to reside at the base of the spine, which can be awakened through Tantric practices to ascend through the chakras.
- **Chakras:** Energy centers located along the spine, each associated with different psychological and spiritual functions.

## Practices
- **Yoga:** Physical postures and breathing exercises to prepare the body and mind for higher states of consciousness.
- **Mantra:** Sacred sounds, words, or phrases repeated to invoke deities or achieve specific spiritual effects.
- **Mudra:** Symbolic hand gestures used in meditation and ritual to channel energy and express spiritual concepts.

## Types of Tantra
- **Right-Hand Tantra:** Generally refers to practices that are more conservative and adhere to traditional moral codes.
- **Left-Hand Tantra:** Often involves practices that challenge conventional norms, sometimes including taboo elements, to achieve spiritual breakthroughs.
