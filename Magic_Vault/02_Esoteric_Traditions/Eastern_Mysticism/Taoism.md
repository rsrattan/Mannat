# Taoism

A philosophical and spiritual tradition of Chinese origin which emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao (the 'Way'). Taoism advocates for simplicity, naturalness, and a deep connection with the rhythms of the universe.

## Core Concepts
- **The Tao:** The absolute principle underlying the universe, combining within itself the principles of yin and yang and signifying the way or code of behavior that is in harmony with the natural order.
- **Yin and Yang:** Two complementary forces that describe how seemingly opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world.
- **Wu Wei:** (Non-action) A concept that advocates for effortless action, spontaneous action, and alignment with the flow of the Tao rather than striving against it.

## Sacred Texts
- **Tao Te Ching:** The foundational text of Taoism, traditionally attributed to Laozi, offering profound insights into the nature of the Tao and how to live in harmony with it.
- **Zhuangzi:** A collection of anecdotes and parables that explore themes of freedom, spontaneity, and the relativity of human values.

## Practices
- **Meditation:** Various forms of meditation are practiced to cultivate inner peace, clarity, and connection with the Tao.
- **Internal Alchemy (Neidan):** Practices aimed at transforming the body and spirit to achieve immortality or spiritual enlightenment.
- **Martial Arts:** Many Chinese martial arts, such as Tai Chi Chuan, are deeply rooted in Taoist philosophy and principles.
