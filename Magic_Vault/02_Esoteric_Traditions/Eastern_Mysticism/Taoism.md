# Taoism

A philosophical and spiritual tradition of Chinese origin which emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao (the 'Way'). Taoism advocates for simplicity, naturalness, and a deep connection with the rhythms of the universe.

## Core Concepts
- **The Tao:** The absolute principle underlying the universe, combining within itself the principles of yin and yang and signifying the way or code of behavior that is in harmony with the natural order.
- **Yin and Yang:** Two complementary forces that describe how seemingly opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world.
- **Wu Wei:** (Non-action) A concept that advocates for effortless action, spontaneous action, and alignment with the flow of the Tao rather than striving against it.

## Sacred Texts
- **Tao Te Ching:** The foundational text of Taoism, traditionally attributed to Laozi, offering profound insights into the nature of the Tao and how to live in harmony with it.
- **Zhuangzi:** A collection of anecdotes and parables that explore themes of freedom, spontaneity, and the relativity of human values.

## Meditative Practices
Taoist meditation aims to harmonize with the Tao by cultivating and circulating vital energy (Qi), quieting the mind, and unifying body and spirit.

- **Emptiness Meditation (Zuowang):** Literally "sitting and forgetting," this is a core practice of sitting quietly to empty the mind of all thoughts and mental images. The goal is to achieve a state of profound stillness and emptiness, allowing one's spirit to be replenished.
- **Breathing Meditation (Zhuanqi):** This practice focuses on the breath to unite the mind and Qi. It can range from simple observation of the breath to more complex patterns of inhalation and exhalation designed to circulate energy through the body.
- **Inner Observation (Neiguan):** A form of visualization where the practitioner turns their awareness inward to observe the body's organs, energy pathways (meridians), and the flow of Qi. This is a key component of Taoist internal alchemy (Neidan).
- **Qigong:** A broader practice of "life energy cultivation" that combines slow movements, breathwork, and meditation to improve health and circulate Qi.
