# Sufism

Known as Islamic mysticism, it is a mystical body of religious practice within Islam characterized by a focus on purification of the self and direct experience of God. Sufis seek to find the truth of divine love and knowledge through direct personal experience of God.

## Core Concepts
- **Tawhid:** The absolute oneness of God, a central tenet of Islam, which Sufis interpret as the ultimate reality of existence.
- **Dhikr:** (Remembrance of God) A form of devotion, associated with Sufism, in which the worshiper is absorbed in the rhythmic repetition of the name of God or other devotional phrases.

## Practices
- **Whirling Dervishes (Sema):** A form of physically active meditation practiced by the Mevlevi Order, involving a spinning dance to achieve religious ecstasy.
- **Meditation and Contemplation:** Sufis engage in various forms of meditation, often focusing on the attributes of God and seeking inner purification.

## Key Figures
- **Rumi:** A 13th-century Persian poet, Islamic scholar, and theologian, whose works are widely read and revered for their mystical insights.
- **Al-Ghazali:** A prominent Persian polymath, philosopher, theologian, and mystic, whose work reconciled Sufism with orthodox Islam.
