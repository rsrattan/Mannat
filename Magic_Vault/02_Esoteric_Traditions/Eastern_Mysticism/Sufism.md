# Sufism

Known as Islamic mysticism, it is a mystical body of religious practice within Islam characterized by a focus on purification of the self and direct experience of God. Sufis seek to find the truth of divine love and knowledge through direct personal experience of God.

## Core Concepts
- **Tawhid:** The absolute oneness of God, a central tenet of Islam, which Sufis interpret as the ultimate reality of existence.
- **Dhikr:** (Remembrance of God) A form of devotion, associated with Sufism, in which the worshiper is absorbed in the rhythmic repetition of the name of God or other devotional phrases.

## Meditative & Contemplative Practices
Sufi practice is centered on the purification of the inner self and the attainment of a direct, personal experience of God. Meditation is a key tool in this process.

- **Dhikr (Remembrance):** The cornerstone of Sufi practice. It involves the rhythmic repetition of the names of God or sacred phrases, either silently or aloud. This constant remembrance helps to focus the mind, open the heart, and achieve a state of continuous awareness of the Divine.
- **Muraqaba (Silent Meditation):** A form of silent contemplation and watchfulness. The practitioner aims to empty the heart of all concerns except God, focusing on the feeling that God is always present and aware of one's innermost state.
- **Sema (Whirling):** Most famously practiced by the Mevlevi Order (Whirling Dervishes), the Sema is a physically active meditation. The whirling dance, accompanied by music and chanting, is a symbolic representation of the soul's journey to God, inducing a state of spiritual ecstasy and union.
- **Fikr (Contemplation):** Deep reflection on the signs of God in creation, the verses of the Quran, and the nature of existence. This analytical meditation aims to cultivate wisdom and a profound sense of gratitude.
## Key Figures
- **Rumi:** A 13th-century Persian poet, Islamic scholar, and theologian, whose works are widely read and revered for their mystical insights.
- **Al-Ghazali:** A prominent Persian polymath, philosopher, theologian, and mystic, whose work reconciled Sufism with orthodox Islam.
