# Centering Prayer

Centering Prayer is a method of silent prayer that prepares us to receive the gift of contemplative prayer, in which we experience God's presence within us. It is a contemporary adaptation of the ancient Christian contemplative practices.

## The Method

The practice of Centering Prayer involves four simple steps:

1.  **Choose a Sacred Word:** Select a sacred word as the symbol of your intention to consent to God's presence and action within. The word should be short, such as "God," "Jesus," "Peace," "Love," or "Silence."

2.  **Sit Comfortably:** Sit comfortably with your eyes closed, and silently introduce the sacred word.

3.  **Engage with Thoughts:** When you become aware of thoughts, return ever-so-gently to the sacred word. The goal is not to suppress thoughts, but to let them go and gently return your focus.

4.  **Closing the Prayer:** After a set period of time (e.g., 20 minutes), remain in silence for a few minutes with your eyes closed.

## The Goal

The primary goal of Centering Prayer is not to have a particular experience, but to deepen one's relationship with God. It is a practice of surrender, letting go of the ego's desire to control and simply being present to the Divine.
