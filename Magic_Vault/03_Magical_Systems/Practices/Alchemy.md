# Alchemy

An ancient branch of natural philosophy, alchemy is a philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout Europe, Africa, and Asia. It combined elements of chemistry, metallurgy, physics, medicine, astrology, semiotics, mysticism, spiritualism, and art.

## Goals
- **The Philosopher's Stone:** A legendary substance, capable of turning base metals into gold (chrysopoeia) and of being an elixir of life.
- **Elixir of Life:** A potion that grants the drinker eternal life or eternal youth.
- **Transmutation:** The transformation of one element into another, both physically and spiritually.

## Key Concepts
- **The Four Elements:** Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, believed to be the fundamental components of all matter.
- **The Magnum Opus (Great Work):** The process of achieving the Philosopher's Stone, often interpreted as a spiritual journey of self-transformation.
- **Solve et Coagula:** "Dissolve and Coagulate" - a core alchemical principle representing the process of breaking down and rebuilding, both materially and spiritually.

## Philosophical Alchemy
- Beyond its material goals, alchemy was deeply concerned with spiritual transformation. The purification of metals was seen as analogous to the purification of the soul.
- The journey to create the Philosopher's Stone was often a metaphor for achieving spiritual enlightenment and union with the divine.
