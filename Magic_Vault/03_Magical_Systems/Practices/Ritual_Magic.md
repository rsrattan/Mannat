# Ritual Magic

A broad term used to describe a wide variety of magical rites that are characterized by ceremony and ritual. It often involves precise actions, specific words, and the use of symbolic tools to achieve a desired magical outcome.

## Core Principles
- **Intention:** The clear and focused will of the practitioner is paramount in directing magical energy.
- **Symbolism:** Ritual magic heavily relies on symbols, correspondences, and archetypes to communicate with the subconscious and higher planes.
- **Correspondence:** The belief that different elements (colors, planets, numbers, deities) are interconnected and can be used to influence each other.

## Common Elements
- **Sacred Space:** Often created by casting a magic circle, which serves as a protective barrier and a consecrated area for magical work.
- **Tools:** Wands, swords, chalices, pentacles, and other implements are used to direct energy and symbolize magical principles.
- **Invocations & Evocations:** Calling upon divine or spiritual entities (invocations) or commanding them to appear (evocations) to assist in magical operations.

## Examples
- [[Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram]]: A foundational ritual for clearing and protecting a space.
- **Enochian Magic:** A system of ceremonial magic based on the 16th-century writings of John Dee and Edward Kelley.
- **Goetia:** A system of magic involving the evocation of demons, often for practical purposes.
