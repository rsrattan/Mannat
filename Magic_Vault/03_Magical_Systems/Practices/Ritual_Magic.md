# Ritual Magic

A broad term used to describe a wide variety of magical rites that are characterized by ceremony and ritual. It often involves precise actions, specific words, and the use of symbolic tools to achieve a desired magical outcome.

## Core Principles
- **Intention:** The clear and focused will of the practitioner is paramount in directing magical energy.
- **Symbolism:** Ritual magic heavily relies on symbols, correspondences, and archetypes to communicate with the subconscious and higher planes.
- **Correspondence:** The belief that different elements (colors, planets, numbers, deities) are interconnected and can be used to influence each other.

## Common Elements
- **Sacred Space:** Often created by casting a magic circle, which serves as a protective barrier and a consecrated area for magical work.
- **Tools:** Wands, swords, chalices, pentacles, and other implements are used to direct energy and symbolize magical principles.
- **Invocations & Evocations:** Calling upon divine or spiritual entities (invocations) or commanding them to appear (evocations) to assist in magical operations.

## The Role of Meditation in Ritual
Meditation is a foundational skill for the ritual magician, essential for developing the mental discipline required for effective practice.

- **Concentration and Focus:** Rituals require the ability to hold complex visualizations and maintain unwavering intention. Meditation trains the mind to concentrate and avoid distraction, which is crucial for directing magical energy.
- **Achieving Trance States:** Effective ritual work often requires entering an altered state of consciousness or trance. Meditation is the primary method for learning to quiet the conscious mind and access deeper, more receptive levels of the psyche.
- **Grounding and Centering:** Before and after a ritual, meditation is used to ground and center the practitioner. This involves connecting with the earth's energy and finding a point of inner balance, which is vital for both stability during the ritual and returning to a normal state of consciousness afterward.

## Examples
- [[Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram]]: A foundational ritual for clearing and protecting a space.
- **Enochian Magic:** A system of ceremonial magic based on the 16th-century writings of John Dee and Edward Kelley.
- **Goetia:** A system of magic involving the evocation of demons, often for practical purposes.
