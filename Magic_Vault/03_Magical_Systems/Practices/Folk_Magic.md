# Folk Magic

Magical practices which are a part of the folklore of a society, often concerned with practical, everyday needs. Unlike ceremonial magic, folk magic is typically less formalized, more accessible, and deeply integrated into local cultural beliefs and traditions.

## Characteristics
- **Practicality:** Often focused on immediate, tangible results such as healing, protection, luck, love, or prosperity.
- **Local Traditions:** Varies greatly by region and culture, drawing upon local beliefs, plants, and spirits.
- **Accessibility:** Practices are often passed down orally or through simple instruction, not requiring extensive formal training.

## The Role of Intention & Meditation
In folk magic, the practitioner's mind is the most important tool. The power behind a spell or charm comes from focused, heartfelt intention, which is often cultivated through simple, practical forms of meditation.

- **Focused Intention:** The core of folk magic is having a clear and specific goal. Before any action is taken, the practitioner focuses their will entirely on the desired outcome, believing this to be the primary force that directs the magic.
- **Simple Meditation & Visualization:** Rather than complex rituals, folk magic often employs simple meditative techniques. This can involve sitting quietly and breathing deeply to calm the mind, then vividly visualizing the desired outcome as if it has already happened. This mental rehearsal charges the spell with energy and intent.

## Common Practices
- **Charms and Amulets:** Objects imbued with magical properties for protection or to attract desired outcomes.
- **Healing:** Use of herbs, rituals, and spiritual remedies to cure ailments.
- **Divination:** Simple methods of foretelling the future or gaining insight, often using everyday objects.
- **Protection:** Spells or rituals to ward off evil, bad luck, or negative influences.

## Examples

- **Pow-wow:** A system of Pennsylvania Dutch folk magic and healing.
- **Cunning Folk:** Traditional practitioners of folk magic in Britain and Ireland, offering services like healing, divination, and counter-magic.
