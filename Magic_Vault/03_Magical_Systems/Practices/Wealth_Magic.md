# Wealth Magic

Wealth magic, also known as prosperity magic, is a branch of magical practice focused on attracting wealth, abundance, and financial stability. It is not about creating money out of thin air, but about aligning your energy and actions with the flow of prosperity.

## Core Principles

*   **Mindset of Abundance:** The foundation of all wealth magic is a mindset of abundance. This means shifting your focus from what you lack to what you have, and cultivating a genuine belief that you are worthy of wealth.
*   **Energy Work:** Wealth magic involves working with the energy of money. Money is a form of energy that flows, and the goal is to attract that flow towards you.
*   **Action:** Magic is not a substitute for action. Spells and meditations for wealth should be accompanied by practical steps in the material world, such as seeking new opportunities, managing your finances, and working towards your goals.

## Common Practices

*   **Deity Work:** Connecting with deities associated with wealth is a common practice. This can involve meditation, offerings, and prayer.
    *   **[[Lakshmi]]**: The Hindu goddess of wealth and prosperity.
    *   **[[Kubera]]**: The Hindu god of material wealth and treasures.
    *   **[[Plutus]]**: The Greek god of wealth.
*   **Sigil Magic:** Creating and charging [[Sigils]] with the intention of attracting wealth.
*   **Candle Magic:** Using colored candles (often green or gold) inscribed with symbols or sigils to represent your financial goals.
*   **Herbs and Crystals:** Using herbs (like cinnamon, mint, or basil) and crystals (like citrine, pyrite, or green aventurine) that are associated with prosperity.

## A Simple Wealth Meditation

1.  **Ground and Center:** Sit in a quiet space and take a few deep breaths to ground and center yourself.
2.  **Visualize:** Close your eyes and visualize a golden or green light surrounding you. This is the light of prosperity.
3.  **Feel the Abundance:** Imagine what it would feel like to be financially secure. Feel the emotions of joy, relief, and freedom. Don't focus on specific numbers, but on the feeling of abundance.
4.  **Affirmations:** Repeat affirmations such as "I am a magnet for money," "Prosperity flows to me," or "I am open and receptive to all the wealth life offers me."
5.  **Gratitude:** End your meditation by expressing gratitude for the wealth you already have, no matter how small it may seem.
