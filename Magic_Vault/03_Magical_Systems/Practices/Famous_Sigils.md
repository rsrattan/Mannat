# Famous Historical Sigils

While modern chaos magic popularizes the creation of personal sigils, many magical traditions have made use of pre-existing, famous sigils that have been charged with meaning and power over centuries. These symbols are often used in ceremonial magic, on talismans, and as focal points for meditation.

## The Seal of Solomon

Also known as the Hexagram, this symbol consists of two interlocking triangles, one pointing up and one pointing down. In medieval Jewish, Christian, and Islamic magical traditions, it was used to symbolize the authority to command spirits and was believed to be a powerful protective emblem. It represents the union of opposites and the concept of "As above, so below."

## Sigils of the Goetia

The *Lesser Key of Solomon* is a famous grimoire that contains the sigils of 72 demons or spirits. Each sigil is a unique design that acts as a magical signature for a specific entity. These sigils are used in ceremonial magic to invoke and command these spirits.

## Planetary Sigils

Derived from the work of Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, these are sigils created from magic squares associated with the seven classical planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn). Each planet has a unique sigil that is used to invoke its specific energies. For example, the sigil of Venus might be used in a ritual for love, while the sigil of Jupiter would be for prosperity.

## The Aegishjalmur (Helm of Awe)

An Icelandic magical stave, the Helm of Awe is a sigil composed of eight arms that radiate from a central point. It was traditionally used by warriors as a symbol of protection and to induce fear in one's enemies. It is a powerful symbol for personal power and invincibility.

## The Ankh

An ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol resembling a cross with a loop at the top. The Ankh is a symbol of life, immortality, and divine authority. It was often depicted being held by gods and pharaohs and was used in funerary rites to ensure eternal life.

## The Sator Square

This is a five-line palindrome of Latin words: SATOR AREPO TENET OPERA ROTAS. It has been found in various locations across the Roman Empire. It was considered a magical formula with protective properties, and its intricate, palindromic nature was seen as a source of its power.
