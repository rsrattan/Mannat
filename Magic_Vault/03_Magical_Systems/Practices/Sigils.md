# Sigils

A type of symbol used in magic, representing a desired outcome, which is created and charged with intention. Sigils are a powerful tool in chaos magic and other modern magical practices for manifesting desires.

## Creation Process
1.  **Formulate a Clear Intention:** State your desire in a positive, concise sentence (e.g., "I am confident and successful.").
2.  **Remove Duplicates:** Eliminate all repeating letters from the sentence.
3.  **Design the Sigil:** Combine the remaining letters into a unique, abstract symbol. This can involve overlapping, removing vowels, or using a magic square.

## Charging and Launching
- **Charging:** The act of imbuing the sigil with magical energy. This is often done by entering a gnostic state (a state of no-mind or intense focus) through meditation, chanting, or physical exertion.
- **Launching:** Releasing the charged sigil into the subconscious mind or the universe, often by destroying it (burning, burying, tearing) or forgetting its original meaning.

## Purpose
- Sigils are used to bypass the conscious mind's skepticism and directly impress a desire upon the subconscious, which then works to manifest it in reality.
- They are a form of magical programming, designed to influence outcomes through focused will and symbolic representation.
