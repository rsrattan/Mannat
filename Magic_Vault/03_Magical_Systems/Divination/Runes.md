# Runes

Letters in a set of related alphabets known as runic alphabets, used to write various Germanic languages before the adoption of the Latin alphabet and for divination. Runes are not just letters but also symbols with deep magical and spiritual meanings.

## Origins and History
- Runic alphabets were used by Germanic peoples from the 1st to the 16th centuries. The word "rune" itself means "secret, mystery, or whisper."
- They were used for writing, but also for magic, divination, and protection.

## The Elder Futhark
- The oldest form of the runic alphabet, consisting of 24 runes, arranged in three groups of eight (aettir).
- **Examples:**
    - **Fehu (ᚠ):** Cattle, wealth, abundance.
    - **Uruz (ᚢ):** Wild ox, strength, primal force.
    - **Thurisaz (ᚦ):** Thorn, giant, protection, destructive force.
    - **Ansuz (ᚨ):** A god, divine inspiration, communication.
    - **Raido (ᚱ):** Journey, movement, rhythm.

## Divinatory Use
- Runes are typically cast or drawn from a bag and interpreted based on their individual meaning, their position (upright or reversed), and their relationship to other runes in a spread.
- They are often used for self-reflection, guidance, and understanding underlying energies rather than predicting specific future events.
