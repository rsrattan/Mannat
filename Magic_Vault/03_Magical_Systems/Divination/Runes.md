# Runes

Letters in a set of related alphabets known as runic alphabets, used to write various Germanic languages before the adoption of the Latin alphabet and for divination. Runes are not just letters but also symbols with deep magical and spiritual meanings.

## Origins and History
- Runic alphabets were used by Germanic peoples from the 1st to the 16th centuries. The word "rune" itself means "secret, mystery, or whisper."
- They were used for writing, but also for magic, divination, and protection.

## The Elder Futhark
- The oldest form of the runic alphabet, consisting of 24 runes, arranged in three groups of eight (aettir).
- **Examples:**
    - **Fehu (ᚠ):** Cattle, wealth, abundance.
    - **Uruz (ᚢ):** Wild ox, strength, primal force.
    - **Thurisaz (ᚦ):** Thorn, giant, protection, destructive force.
    - **Ansuz (ᚨ):** A god, divine inspiration, communication.
    - **Raido (ᚱ):** Journey, movement, rhythm.

## Rune Meditation & Magic
Beyond divination, runes are powerful tools for meditation and magical work, used to internalize their concepts and energies.

- **Galdr (Runic Chanting):** A core practice involving the chanting or singing of a rune's name or phonetic sound. The vibration of the sound is believed to activate the rune's power, focus the mind, and induce a meditative state, allowing the practitioner to connect deeply with the rune's essence.
- **Stadha (Rune Posture):** A practice of assuming the physical shape of a rune with one's body. This form of runic yoga is believed to align the practitioner's physical and energetic bodies with the specific energies of the rune.
- **Visualization:** A simple yet powerful technique where one meditates by vividly visualizing a specific rune in the mind's eye. This can be used to invoke the rune's qualities, such as visualizing Fehu for abundance or Thurisaz for protection.
