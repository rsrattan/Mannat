# Tarot

A pack of playing cards, used from the mid-15th century in various parts of Europe to play games, and later for divination. Tarot cards are used to gain insight into past, present, or future situations by posing a question to the cards and interpreting their symbolism.

## Structure of a Deck
- A standard Tarot deck consists of 78 cards, divided into two main sections: the Major Arcana and the Minor Arcana.

## Major Arcana
- Comprises 22 cards, typically unnumbered or numbered 0 to 21. These cards represent major life lessons, karmic influences, and archetypal themes.
- **Examples:** The Fool (new beginnings), The Magician (manifestation), The High Priestess (intuition), The Lovers (choices), Death (transformation), The World (completion).

## Minor Arcana
- Comprises 56 cards, divided into four suits, much like a regular playing card deck. These cards reflect the day-to-day events and challenges of life.
- **Suits:**
    - **Wands:** Represents creativity, passion, and ambition.
    - **Cups:** Represents emotions, relationships, and intuition.
    - **Swords:** Represents intellect, challenges, and truth.
    - **Pentacles:** Represents material possessions, work, and security.
- Each suit has cards numbered Ace through Ten, and four court cards: Page, Knight, Queen, and King.
