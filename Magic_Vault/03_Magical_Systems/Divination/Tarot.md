# Tarot

A pack of playing cards, used from the mid-15th century in various parts of Europe to play games, and later for divination. Tarot cards are used to gain insight into past, present, or future situations by posing a question to the cards and interpreting their symbolism.

## Structure of a Deck
- A standard Tarot deck consists of 78 cards, divided into two main sections: the Major Arcana and the Minor Arcana.

## Major Arcana
- Comprises 22 cards, typically unnumbered or numbered 0 to 21. These cards represent major life lessons, karmic influences, and archetypal themes.
- **Examples:** The Fool (new beginnings), The Magician (manifestation), The High Priestess (intuition), The Lovers (choices), Death (transformation), The World (completion).

## Minor Arcana
- Comprises 56 cards, divided into four suits, much like a regular playing card deck. These cards reflect the day-to-day events and challenges of life.
- **Suits:**
    - **Wands:** Represents creativity, passion, and ambition.
    - **Cups:** Represents emotions, relationships, and intuition.
    - **Swords:** Represents intellect, challenges, and truth.
    - **Pentacles:** Represents material possessions, work, and security.
- Each suit has cards numbered Ace through Ten, and four court cards: Page, Knight, Queen, and King.

## Tarot for Meditation
Beyond divination, the Tarot is a powerful tool for meditation and self-discovery, using its rich symbolism as a focal point.

- **Single-Card Contemplation:** This simple practice involves drawing a single card and using it as the focus of a meditation session. The practitioner gazes at the card, observing its colors, characters, and symbols, and reflects on how the card's energy and meaning relate to their own life and inner state.
- **Imaginative Journeying:** A more active form of meditation where the practitioner visualizes the chosen card becoming a gateway. They mentally "step into" the scene of the card, interacting with its landscape and figures to gain deeper, intuitive insights. This is a form of active imagination or pathworking.
- **Journaling:** After a meditation session, journaling about the experience, feelings, and any messages received helps to solidify the insights and integrate the card's wisdom.
