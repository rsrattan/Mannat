# Scrying

Scrying is the practice of looking into a suitable medium in the belief that it will reveal messages or visions. The medium can be a crystal ball, a mirror, water, smoke, or other reflective surfaces.

## Methods of Scrying
- **Crystal Gazing:** Using a crystal ball to induce visions or receive messages.
- **Mirror Scrying:** Using a black mirror or a regular mirror in dim light to see images or symbols.
- **Hydromancy:** Scrying using water, often by observing reflections or patterns in a bowl of water.
- **Capnomancy:** Scrying using smoke, interpreting the shapes and movements of smoke from incense or a fire.

## The Meditative State for Scrying
Effective scrying depends on achieving a specific meditative state to quiet the conscious mind and become receptive to subtle visions and insights.

- **Deep Relaxation:** The process begins with calming the body and mind. This is often achieved through deep, rhythmic breathing (pranayama) and progressive muscle relaxation to release physical tension.
- **Achieving a Light Trance:** The goal is to enter a light trance or hypnagogic state. This can be facilitated by focusing on the breath, repeating a mantra, or using drumming sounds to shift awareness from the analytical mind to the intuitive, subconscious mind.
- **The Soft Gaze:** When looking at the scrying medium, it is crucial to use a "soft gaze," allowing the eyes to relax and become slightly unfocused. Straining or trying to force images to appear is counterproductive. Visions often appear in the peripheral vision or as fleeting shapes that gradually take form.
