# Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram

The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP) is a foundational ceremonial magic ritual. It is used to clear a space of negative or unwanted energies, to set up a sacred space for magical work, and to help quiet the mind for meditation. It is often considered a first step for those beginning their study of Western esoteric traditions.
