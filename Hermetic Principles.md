# Hermetic Principles

The Seven Hermetic Principles are a series of axioms from the book "The Kybalion" which are said to have originated from the ancient Egyptian sage Hermes Trismegistus. They form the basis of Hermetic philosophy.

1.  **The Principle of Mentalism:** "The All is Mind; the Universe is Mental."
2.  **The Principle of Correspondence:** "As above, so below; as below, so above."
3.  **The Principle of Vibration:** "Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates."
4.  **The Principle of Polarity:** "Everything is dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites."
5.  **The Principle of Rhythm:** "Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides; all things rise and fall."
6.  **The Principle of Cause and Effect:** "Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause."
7.  **The Principle of Gender:** "Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine and Feminine Principles."

## Meditation on the Hermetic Principles

Hermetic meditation is not about emptying the mind, but about using it as a tool for understanding the universe and one's place in it. The seven principles are not just intellectual concepts, but keys to unlocking a deeper understanding of reality through contemplation.

*   **Contemplation of the Principles:** A core practice involves taking one principle at a time and meditating on it. For example, to meditate on the Principle of Vibration, one could sit quietly and become aware of the subtle vibrations in the body, the room, and the world outside, realizing that everything is in constant motion.

*   **The All is Mind:** Meditating on the Principle of Mentalism involves the realization that the universe is a mental creation. A practitioner might focus on the idea that their thoughts are shaping their reality, and by controlling their mind, they can influence their life.

*   **As Above, So Below:** This principle is a powerful tool for meditation. One can visualize the solar system and see the planets orbiting the sun, and then visualize the electrons orbiting the nucleus of an atom, contemplating the correspondence between the macrocosm and the microcosm.
