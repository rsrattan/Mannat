# Hermetic Principles

The Seven Hermetic Principles are a series of axioms from the book "The Kybalion" which are said to have originated from the ancient Egyptian sage Hermes Trismegistus. They form the basis of Hermetic philosophy.

1.  **The Principle of Mentalism:** "The All is Mind; the Universe is Mental."
2.  **The Principle of Correspondence:** "As above, so below; as below, so above."
3.  **The Principle of Vibration:** "Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates."
4.  **The Principle of Polarity:** "Everything is dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites."
5.  **The Principle of Rhythm:** "Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides; all things rise and fall."
6.  **The Principle of Cause and Effect:** "Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause."
7.  **The Principle of Gender:** "Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine and Feminine Principles."
