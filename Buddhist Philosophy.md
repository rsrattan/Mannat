# Buddhist Philosophy

Buddhist philosophy is a system of thought that originated with the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha. At its core are the Four Noble Truths, which diagnose the nature of suffering, and the Eightfold Path, which prescribes a practical guide to end that suffering. The ultimate goal is to achieve Nirvana—a state of liberation, peace, and the cessation of the cycle of rebirth.

## Meditation in Buddhist Philosophy

Meditation (Bhavana) is the central tool in Buddhist philosophy for achieving enlightenment. It's not just about relaxation, but about the cultivation of mind and the development of wisdom. There are two main types of meditation that are often practiced in conjunction:

*   **Samatha (Tranquility/Calm) Meditation:** The goal of Samatha meditation is to calm the mind and develop deep concentration (Samadhi). This is often achieved by focusing on a single object, such as the breath (Anapanasati). A calm and focused mind is the necessary foundation for developing insight.

*   **Vipassanā (Insight) Meditation:** With the stable mind developed through Samatha, Vipassanā meditation is practiced to gain insight into the true nature of reality. This involves observing the three marks of existence: impermanence (Anicca), suffering or unsatisfactoriness (Dukkha), and non-self (Anatta). This insight is what leads to liberation.

These two practices are often described as the two wings of a bird, both being essential for flight (enlightenment).
