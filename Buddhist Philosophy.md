# Buddhist Philosophy

Buddhist philosophy is a system of thought that originated with the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha. At its core are the Four Noble Truths, which diagnose the nature of suffering, and the Eightfold Path, which prescribes a practical guide to end that suffering. The ultimate goal is to achieve Nirvana—a state of liberation, peace, and the cessation of the cycle of rebirth.
